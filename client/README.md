# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Resume Provider - Enhanced Features

## New Template & Output Format Features

### Multiple Resume Templates
The Resume Provider application now includes multiple template options for resume creation:

1. **Modern** - Clean, modern design with centered header and section titles with bottom borders
2. **Professional** - Two-column header format with left-bordered section titles for a corporate look
3. **Creative** - Colorful gradient header with chip-style contact information for creative professionals
4. **Minimal** - Super clean and minimalistic design with light typography and spacing

Users can choose from these templates in the last step of the resume creation process, providing a visual preview of each style.

### Multiple Output Formats
The application now supports exporting resumes in multiple file formats:

1. **PDF Format** - Professional-grade PDF for printing and formal submissions
2. **Word Document (DOCX)** - Editable document format for further customization
3. **Plain Text (TXT)** - Simple text format for pasting into online applications or emails

## Required Dependencies for New Features

To implement the new export features, you'll need to install the following libraries:

```bash
npm install html2canvas jspdf file-saver
```

### Library Purposes:
- **html2canvas**: Captures the resume template as an image for PDF export
- **jspdf**: Converts the captured image into a downloadable PDF document
- **file-saver**: Provides cross-browser file saving functionality for DOCX and TXT formats

## Implementation Details

### Templates
Templates are defined in the `CreateResume.js` component using a configuration array with color schemes and styling properties for each template variant. The templates are rendered conditionally based on the user's selection.

### Export Functionality
- **PDF Export**: Uses html2canvas to capture the resume DOM element, then creates a PDF using jsPDF
- **DOCX Export**: Creates a simplified HTML document wrapped in a blob with Word-compatible formatting
- **TXT Export**: Generates a plain text representation of the resume data with proper formatting and structure

## Future Enhancements
- Add more template designs with varied layouts and color schemes
- Implement advanced PDF customization options (margins, paper size)
- Provide template preview in a carousel format
- Support for custom template color selection
